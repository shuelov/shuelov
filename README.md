# Welcome to shuelov's area âœ¨
##  ðŸ‘‹ Hey there!
 I am game dev from South Korea who enjoy creating game and also have passion for learning new things. I had chance to learn c, c++, c# and also how to make game during Nov.2017 to Apri.2018 through institution. I was in my 3rd year of University studying Architecture before but after that experience, it influenced me to change major to the computer science because I wanted to be a game developer.:computer: I'm pretty sure game development fits my aptitude. 

 I usually make games by using Unity3D. I worked on few mobile and pc games. I'm interested in develop VR game.

ðŸ’– What I'm into : :cat:, :house:, :muscle:, :airplane:, :video_game:

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote.
